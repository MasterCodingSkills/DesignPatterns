The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms,
encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
client that use it.


Points learned :
1 => Take what varies and "encapsulate" it so it won't
    affect the rest of your code.

    The result is fewer unintended consequences from
    code changes and more flexibility in your system.


2 => Favor composition over inheritance.
     Has-A can be better than Is-A
