1 => what if we want to add fly behaviour to ducks.

    if we add fly() method in Duck class than some
    ducks like rubber ducks and wooden ducks which
    should not fly also starts flaying.

    And

    if we add fly() method in every class separately
    than we are over-programming, and we are not
    getting benefits of inheritance.


2 => what if we want to change fly() behavior
     dynamically.
